        <h1>Tab Management Redesign</h1>
        <h2>Improving mobile browser retention through strategic UX improvements</h2>

        <div class="visual-placeholder">

        <div class="case-body">
          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>Aloha Browser had grown to 4 million users, but our outdated tab format was creating friction in a competitive market. Users with multiple tabs struggled to stay organized—older tabs consumed excessive screen space, and power users had no way to group related tabs. These limitations were holding us back against competitors like Chrome, Safari, and Edge who had already introduced grouping functionality.</p>

          <p>As part of a 2-person design team, I led the complete redesign of our tab experience across iOS and Android to improve organization, modernize the interface, and improve retention.</p>

          <div class="section-divider"></div>

          <h2>Discovery & Strategy</h2>
          <p>Initial user feedback came from our community, where users were vocal about needing quality-of-life improvements to tab management. But before diving into design, I aligned with leadership on strategic goals: we were competing with Chrome for users and needed to position Aloha as a viable daily driver—a gateway into our privacy-focused product ecosystem.</p>

          <p>To validate whether tabs were the right priority, I conducted competitive analysis of major browsers including Chrome, Safari, and Edge. The research revealed that tab grouping had become table stakes—every major competitor offered it. We were falling behind on a core feature that power users expected. Combined with community feedback, this built a clear business case: improving tabs wasn't just a nice-to-have, it was essential to remain competitive and retain users.</p>

          <p>With this evidence, I presented my findings and initial UI prototypes to our Design Lead and Product Lead for feedback, then to the Founder, CEO, and iOS/Android engineering leads. The combination of competitive research showing we were falling behind and early prototypes demonstrating a viable solution secured buy-in to move forward.</p>

          <div class="section-divider"></div>

          <h2>Design Process & Solution</h2>

          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>The scope was significant—we needed to update the visual UI, redesign the core tab experience, and coordinate backend changes with engineering, all shipping as a cohesive package. This required careful sequencing: which improvements could ship first on iOS to validate the approach, and what foundational work Android needed before grouping could launch.</p>

          <p>Additionally, I had to balance two user groups: power users who needed sophisticated organization tools, and casual users who just wanted their tabs to work simply. The design couldn't add complexity for the majority while solving for the power user minority.</p>

          <h3>My Approach</h3>
          <p>After securing buy-in, I explored multiple concepts for the grouping functionality, including cross-account sync, bookmark conversion options, and various tab UI treatments. I created platform-specific designs for iOS and Android rather than forcing identical experiences, respecting each platform's patterns and technical constraints.</p>

          </div>

          <p>I designed flexible grouping interactions to accommodate different user preferences. Power users could batch-select multiple tabs and organize them through an action menu, while users managing fewer tabs could drag individual tabs directly into groups. This flexibility ensured the feature worked for both casual and power users without adding unnecessary complexity.</p>

          </div>

          <p>One unconventional decision I'm particularly proud of is the tab mode switcher—allowing users to toggle between Normal, Private, and Sync modes directly within the tab manager. Most browsers require leaving the tab view to switch modes, but this gave power users quick access to different browsing contexts without interrupting their workflow.</p>

            <img src="images/Tabs Mode switching.png" alt="Tab Mode Switcher: Normal/Private/Sync Toggle Interface" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
          </div>

          <p>I worked closely with iOS and Android engineering leads throughout, prototyping in Figma and iterating based on their technical input. This collaboration was critical—when we shipped iOS first, we discovered the initial tab shape didn't work well across different screen orientations. I redesigned it to follow more standard patterns, ensuring consistency whether users were in portrait or landscape.</p>

          <p>On Android, legacy device performance was a major constraint. Loading webpage previews on every tab consumed too many resources on older phones. I designed a fallback state for preview-less tabs, which evolved into an optional feature—users could toggle between preview mode and a more efficient list view. This solved the technical problem while giving all users more control over their experience.</p>

            <img src="images/Tabs Android preview-less tabs.png" alt="Android Preview Toggle: Two States - Preview Mode vs List View" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
          </div>

          <p>The project spanned both iOS and Android with different timelines and technical considerations. iOS received the complete grouping functionality first, allowing us to validate the approach with real metrics. Android received foundational UI improvements with grouping development paused when company priorities shifted to premium features. Each platform required thoughtful adaptation of the design to respect native patterns while maintaining a cohesive Aloha experience.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="section-divider"></div>

          <h2>Impact</h2>

          <div class="impact-metrics">
            <p>Combined retention improvement: 1.8% across platforms</p>
            <p>iOS: 1.2% Day 1 retention improvement</p>
            <p>Android: 0.6% Day 1 retention improvement from UI updates alone</p>
          </div>

          <p>Full iOS grouping shipped in 6 months alongside other product work, with continued refinements over the following 2 months. Android UI improvements shipped as foundation, with grouping development paused when company shifted to premium feature priorities.</p>

          <h3>Project evolution</h3>
          <p>I initially identified tab management issues through direct collaboration with Android engineering while working on other features. This early exploration informed the research and strategy that led to the formal redesign project. The phased iOS-first approach allowed us to validate the concept with real metrics before scaling to Android.</p>

          <h3>Key learnings</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Competitive research built a compelling business case when paired with user feedback</li>
            <li>Platform-specific solutions worked better than forcing identical experiences</li>
            <li>Shipping iOS first to validate reduced risk before full cross-platform investment</li>
            <li>Technical constraints can become user features (preview toggle)</li>
            <li>Post-launch iteration based on real usage (tab shape refinement) improved the experience</li>
