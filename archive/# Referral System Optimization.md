## Impact  
  
**3.4x increase in monthly referrals** (415 → 1,815). Worked iteratively   
from January through November, shipping improvements based on usage data.

## The Problem  
  
Referral system generated only 415 referrals/month despite valuable   
premium rewards. Vague messaging ("Spread digital freedom"), confusing   
interface (QR codes, copy buttons), and unrealistic reward structure.  
  
## My Role  
  
Led iterative redesign working with project manager and iOS/Android   
engineering teams. Started as small project, became significant organic   
acquisition channel.  
  
## Solution  
  
### Simplified Interface  
Removed QR code and copy link options—usage data showed users only   
converted through the native share button. One clear action instead of   
decision paralysis.

### Clear Messaging  
Changed "Spread digital freedom" to "Invite friends – get Free Premium."   
Users immediately understood the value exchange.

### Realistic Rewards  
Revised structure: 1 week premium per friend (up to 10), scaling to   
lifetime premium. Made early wins attainable while rewarding power users.

## Key Insight  
  
Usage data revealed the answer: users weren't confused about how to   
share—they were confused about why to share. Clear incentive + simple   
action = 3.4x growth.
