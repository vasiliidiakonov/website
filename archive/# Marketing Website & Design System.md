## Impact  
  
**+10% conversion** (20% → 30%) and **50% development time reduction**.   
New pages went from 1 week to 2-3 days. Completed in 4 months: 1 month   
strategy alignment, 3 months system development and implementation.

## The Problem  
  
The marketing site converted only 20% of visitors. Every page update   
required custom work—design was the bottleneck. Typography and   
accessibility issues hurt SEO rankings.  
  
## My Role  
  
Led complete redesign as sole designer on 4-person marketing team   
(CMO, ASO manager, illustrator, and myself). Designed all pages and   
built comprehensive design system in Figma.  
  
## Solution  
  
### Design System First  
Built comprehensive system with component library, typography scales,   
color tokens, and layout variables before redesigning pages.

### Automated Responsive Behavior  
Created layout library where designers build once and copy across   
breakpoints—all spacing adjusts automatically via Figma variables.

### Website Redesign  
Improved readability, updated positioning to match privacy-first brand,   
fixed SEO issues, and optimized performance. Used Bootstrap as foundation.

## Key Innovation  
  
The layout system's automated responsive behavior eliminated manual   
adaptation for every breakpoint. This single innovation saved hundreds   
of hours and became how we approach all new pages.
