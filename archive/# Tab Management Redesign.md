## Impact  
  
**1.8% Day 1 retention improvement** across iOS and Android (1.2% iOS,   
0.6% Android). Shipped complete grouping on iOS in 6 months, with   
Android UI foundations laid before company shifted to premium features.

## The Problem  
  
Power users with 20+ tabs couldn't find what they needed. Chrome and   
Safari offered grouping. We didn't. This table-stakes gap was hurting   
retention.  
  
## My Role  
  
Led end-to-end design across iOS and Android as part of a 2-person   
design team at Aloha Browser (4M users). Conducted competitive research,   
designed platform-specific solutions, and partnered with engineering   
through implementation.  
  
## Solution  
  
### Flexible Grouping  
Designed two interaction paths: batch selection for power users organizing   
many tabs, and drag-and-drop for quick one-off organization.

### Mode Switcher  
Created an unconventional tab mode switcher letting users toggle between   
Normal, Private, and Sync modes without leaving the tab manager.

### Platform-Specific Design  
Respected iOS and Android conventions rather than forcing identical   
experiences. iOS shipped with complete grouping; Android received UI   
improvements with grouping planned for future release.

### Android Performance Solution  
Turned a constraint into a feature: designed a toggle between rich tab   
previews and an efficient list mode for older devices.

## Key Decisions  
  
Shipped iOS first to validate with real metrics before full cross-platform   
investment. Iterated post-launch when tab shapes didn't work across   
orientations. Collaborated closely with iOS and Android engineering leads   
throughout implementation.
