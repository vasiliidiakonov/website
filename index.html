                <div class="collapsible-content">
                  <h2>Discovery & Strategy</h2>

                  <p>Conducted competitive analysis of Chrome, Safari, Edge, and Firefox tab grouping implementations. Identified key patterns: visual grouping, drag-and-drop organization, and persistent group state.</p>

                  <p>Gathered user feedback from community forums and support channels. Power users with 20+ tabs consistently reported frustration with finding specific tabs. Usage data showed that these power users had 3x higher churn than average users.</p>

                  <p>Built business case demonstrating that tab grouping was becoming table stakes in the browser category. Presented competitive gap analysis to leadership (Design Lead, Product Lead, CEO, and engineering leads).</p>

                  <p>Secured buy-in by proposing phased rollout: ship iOS first to validate with real metrics, then decide on Android investment. This de-risked the initiative and allowed us to learn fast. Research directly informed the decision to focus on flexibility—supporting both bulk organization and spontaneous grouping.</p>

                  <h2>Design Decisions & Rationale</h2>

                  <p>Designed two interaction paths after observing that users organize tabs in two distinct ways: bulk organization sessions (reorganizing many tabs at once) and opportunistic grouping (moving one tab while browsing).</p>

                  <p>Batch selection serves power users who need to organize 20+ tabs quickly. Select multiple tabs with checkboxes, then group with one action. Drag-and-drop serves casual users making quick, spontaneous moves between existing groups. This flexibility accommodates different user types and contexts.</p>

                  <p>Most browsers make users exit the tab manager to switch between normal and private modes. This creates unnecessary friction. By embedding the mode switcher directly in the tab manager, we reduced this multi-step process to a single tap, keeping users in their flow.</p>

                  <p>Gave Sync mode (cross-device tab syncing, unique to Aloha) equal prominence with Normal and Private. This positioning elevated sync from a hidden feature to a first-class capability, supporting our power user value proposition.</p>

                  <p>Created distinct visual treatment for private mode using a darker color palette and unique iconography. This clear differentiation helps users feel confident they're in a secure browsing context—critical for a privacy-focused browser. By giving private mode equal prominence and full grouping support, we reinforced Aloha's core privacy-first brand promise.</p>

                  <p>Made groups collapsible with clear visual hierarchy. Group headers show tab count and support quick actions: rename, color picker, and delete. Color coding helps users create mental models ("work" is blue, "shopping" is green, etc.).</p>

                  <h2>Implementation Approach</h2>

                  <p>Shipped iOS first to validate the grouping concept with real user metrics before investing in full Android implementation. This strategy de-risked the feature—if grouping flopped on iOS, we'd save months of Android development.</p>

                  <p>iOS users adopted grouping quickly: 43% created at least one group within the first week, and Day 1 retention improved by 1.2%. This validated the concept and greenlit Android development.</p>

                  <p>Collaborated closely with iOS and Android engineers throughout implementation. Ensured gestures felt platform-native: iOS uses swipe actions for quick group actions, Android uses long-press. Same functionality, platform-appropriate execution.</p>

                  <p>Iterated post-launch when initial tab card shapes caused visual issues across landscape and portrait orientations. Final design simplified the visual system while improving performance.</p>

                  <p>For Android, partnered with the engineering lead to design UI foundations matching Material Design patterns. Android engineering flagged that rich tab previews caused performance issues on devices with limited RAM. Older devices would lag or crash when users had 30+ tabs open.</p>

                  <p>Rather than compromise the experience for all users or abandon visual previews entirely, I designed a user-controlled toggle between preview mode and list mode. List mode uses text-only representation, reducing memory overhead by 60% while maintaining full grouping functionality.</p>

                  <p>Positioned the toggle as a power user feature rather than a technical fallback. The framing was "choose your view" rather than "fix performance problems." This preserved user agency and avoided making legacy device users feel like second-class citizens.</p>

                  <p>Unexpectedly, users with newer devices also switched to list mode when managing 50+ tabs—they discovered it was faster for scanning large collections. The technical constraint became a legitimate feature serving different user needs and contexts.</p>

                  <p>Company pivoted to premium features before Android grouping shipped, but the UI improvements and architecture laid the foundation for future implementation.</p>

                  <h2>Key Learnings</h2>

                  <p>Phased approach (iOS-first) significantly reduced risk. Validating with real metrics before full cross-platform investment saved time and informed better decisions for Android.</p>

                  <p>Platform-specific design decisions (respecting iOS and Android conventions) led to better user adoption than forcing identical experiences would have.</p>

                  <p>Technical constraints can become features when framed correctly. The Android list view toggle became a power user tool, not a compromise.</p>

                  <p>The unconventional mode switcher approach paid off: power users who discovered it had 40% higher engagement with private browsing and 2x higher sync adoption. Sometimes breaking conventions delivers better outcomes.</p>

                  <p>Made strategic decision to build design system first rather than redesigning pages immediately. This required upfront investment but would pay dividends on every subsequent page.</p>

                  <h2>Design System Development</h2>

                  <p>Created prototype sandbox for engineering collaboration. This shared environment allowed engineers to extract tokens and test implementation while design work progressed.</p>

                  <p>Automated responsive behavior development started with identifying pain point: designers manually adjusting every margin and padding across three breakpoints. This tedious work consumed hours and introduced inconsistencies.</p>

                  <p>Figma variables became the key innovation. Built library where every spacing value references a variable that changes based on breakpoint. Designers build desktop layout, duplicate frame, switch to tablet mode—all spacing updates automatically.</p>

                  <p>Bootstrap as foundation decision provided proven responsive patterns and reduced engineering effort. Rather than building custom grid system, leveraged Bootstrap's battle-tested framework and customized visual design.</p>

                  <p>Engineering token extraction workflow: prototype sandbox included all components with documented CSS custom properties. Engineers copied values directly into codebase, ensuring design-code consistency.</p>

                  <p>Documentation approach focused on usage examples rather than exhaustive specifications. Showed real page patterns and common combinations, making system immediately useful to marketing team.</p>

                  <h2>Website Redesign Details</h2>

                  <p>Readability improvements included establishing clear typography hierarchy (48px headlines, 18px body), increasing whitespace between sections, and using color contrast to guide attention.</p>

                  <p>Positioning update aligned with privacy-first brand evolution. Updated messaging from generic browser features to privacy benefits, repositioned against Chrome/Safari, and emphasized data protection throughout.</p>

                  <p>Technical SEO fixes included proper heading hierarchy (single H1, logical H2-H3 structure), comprehensive alt text on all images, and improved color contrast ratios meeting WCAG AA standards.</p>

                  <p>Performance optimizations involved lazy loading images, optimizing asset sizes, and reducing unnecessary JavaScript. Page load time improved by 40%, directly impacting SEO rankings.</p>

                  <p>Page-by-page approach started with homepage as proof of concept, then rolled out to feature pages (VPN, Ad Block, Private AI), and finally to support pages. Each iteration refined the system based on real usage.</p>

                  <h2>Collaboration Process</h2>

                  <p>Daily engineering sync on implementation ensured design intent translated accurately to code. Caught issues early and adjusted design system based on technical constraints.</p>

                  <p>CMO strategic alignment meetings validated messaging changes and positioning updates. Design decisions supported broader marketing strategy rather than existing in isolation.</p>

                  <p>ASO manager SEO collaboration focused on technical improvements (heading hierarchy, alt text, contrast) and content optimization. Design system made implementing SEO best practices consistent across all pages.</p>

                  <p>Illustrator asset integration required establishing clear export specifications and naming conventions. Design system documented how illustrations paired with UI components.</p>

                  <p>Design system created shared language between disciplines. Engineers, marketing team, and leadership could reference specific components and patterns, improving communication efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Design-to-code workflow transformation: before system, every page required custom handoff documentation. After system, engineers referenced component library directly, reducing handoff time from days to hours.</p>

                  <h2>The Innovation</h2>

                  <p>Layout library's automated responsive behavior eliminated the most tedious part of web design. This single innovation saved hundreds of hours and became foundation for all new work.</p>

                  <p>Building system first required upfront investment (1 month planning, 2 months development) but paid dividends immediately—every page became faster and more consistent. First post-launch page took 2 days instead of previous 7-day average.</p>

                  <p>The approach proved that investing in infrastructure delivers compounding returns. System continues to accelerate work 18 months later, enabling marketing team to ship faster while maintaining quality.</p>

              <p><strong>My Role:</strong> End-to-end redesign • Usage data analysis • iOS and Android implementation</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-section">
              <h2>The Problem</h2>

              <p>Referral system generated only 415 referrals/month despite valuable premium rewards. Vague messaging ("Spread digital freedom"), confusing interface with multiple sharing options, and unrealistic reward structure made the feature ineffective.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-section">
              <h2>Solution</h2>

              <h3>Simplified Interface</h3>

              <div class="visual-placeholder">
                <img src="images/referral-ui buttons.png" alt="Simplified interface" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
                <p class="image-caption">Streamlined interface with a single "Invite friends" button. Usage data showed this was the only method users actually converted through, so all other options were removed.</p>
              </div>

              <p>Removed QR code and copy link options entirely. Usage data showed users only converted through the invite button—everything else was friction.</p>

              <h3>Clear Messaging</h3>

              <div class="visual-placeholder">
                <img src="images/referral-messaging.png" alt="Updated messaging" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
                <p class="image-caption">Updated messaging from vague "Spread digital freedom" to clear "Invite friends – get Free Premium." Users immediately understand what they get and what action to take.</p>
              </div>

              <p>Changed from philosophical language to direct value proposition. Users immediately see what they get and what's required.</p>

              <h3>Realistic Reward Structure</h3>

              <div class="visual-placeholder">
                <img src="images/referral-tiers.png" alt="Reward structure" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
                <p class="image-caption">Tiered reward system showing progression from 1 friend (1 week premium) through lifetime premium status. Clear milestones make the system feel achievable.</p>
              </div>

              <p>Revised to 1 week premium per friend (up to 10), scaling to lifetime premium. Made early wins attainable while rewarding power users.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-section">
              <details class="collapsible-section">
                <summary>Read about the process</summary>
                <div class="collapsible-content">
                  <h2>Discovery & Validation</h2>

                  <p>Analyzed usage data showing QR code and copy link had zero conversion. Only the invite button was being used. This data-driven insight informed the simplification strategy.</p>

                  <p>Worked closely with project manager to evolve the feature iteratively. Started as a pet project to improve underperforming system, became strategic organic acquisition initiative as results proved out.</p>

                  <h2>Design Decisions</h2>

                  <p>Removing options improved conversion because decision paralysis was the actual problem. Users weren't confused about how to share—they were confused about why to share and whether it was worth the effort.</p>

                  <p>Messaging transformation moved from clever ("Spread digital freedom") to clear ("Invite friends – get Free Premium"). Clarity beat cleverness. Users needed to understand the value exchange immediately.</p>

                  <p>Reward structure psychology: original system required too many referrals for first reward, making it feel unattainable. New structure gave immediate gratification (1 friend = 1 week) while still incentivizing power users with lifetime premium milestone.</p>

                  <p>Platform-specific considerations around iOS and Android monetization policies required careful navigation to ensure rewards complied with app store guidelines while remaining valuable to users.</p>

                  <h2>Implementation Approach</h2>

                  <p>Shipped iteratively over 11 months rather than one big release. This allowed real-time testing and validation of each change. Measured impact at every step and adjusted based on data.</p>

                  <p>Cross-platform coordination between iOS and Android teams ensured consistent experience while respecting platform-specific patterns and policies.</p>

                  <p>Real-time measurement showed immediate improvements: first simplification increased conversions by 80%, messaging update added another 60%, and reward structure revision drove final 50% increase to reach 3.4x total growth.</p>

                  <h2>Key Insight</h2>

                  <p>Usage data revealed the answer: users weren't confused about how to share—they were confused about why to share. Clear incentive + simple action = 3.4x growth. Sometimes the solution is removing features, not adding them.</p>
